# kubernetes-docker
kubernetes and docker notes and exercises following *Kubernetes in Action* Marko Luksa (Manning) 2017

define aliases to make life easier in ```~/.bash_profile``` by adding ```alias alias_name=full_command```

## docker

### create new container

from directory with Dockerfile
```docker build -t container_name```

### commands

- ```images```: list locally stored images
- ```inspect container_name```: JSON with info
- ```exec -it container_name bash```: running shell inside container. -it: STDIN open, pusedo terminal.
- ```ps```: list running containers
- ```stop``` and ```rm container_name```: stop and remove container.
- ```run -p 8080:8080 -d user/container_name```: run an image on a different machine on port 8080

### pushing to image registry
- ```docker tag image_name user/image_name```
- ```docker push user/image_name```


## kubernetes
```alias k=kubectl```

### creating simple kubernetes cluster with minikube

```minikube start```: sets up a single-node cluster for use in testing kubernetes and developing apps locally
```minikube dashboard```: open GUI

### pods

- A group of related containers that will always run concurrently on the same worker node and in the same namespace. Each pod has its own IP, hostname, processes.
- pods allow for containers inside each group to share certain resources but not all, to achieve this Docker is configured to have all containers of a pod share the same set of Linux namespaces (shared hostname, network interfaces and IPC).
- containers in pods must make sure to not have port conflicts as they share a common port space.
- containers within pods can communicate through localhost
- communicate between separate pods and worker nodes with NAT-less network using the pods routable IP address
- pods are lightweight so dispersing apps into multiple pods is preferable, each one should contain only tightly related processes.
- for example "the main container in a pod could be a web server that serves files from a certain file directory, while an additional container (a sidecar container) periodically downloads content from an external source and stores it in the web serverâ€™s directory."

### scheduling

- distributing pods between worker nodes.

### service object & replication controller

- service object solves problem of ever-changing IPs of pods as they are created and disappear. It also exposes multiple pods at a single consistent IP and port pair
- each pod has its own IP address but it is internal to the cluster and not accessible, it can be exposed through the service object.

**LoadBalancer-type service**: an external load balancer that you can use to connect to a pod through its public IP.

**replicationcontroller**: makes sure there is always one instance of your pod running. Used to replicate pods and keep them running. can define how many replicas is required. If a pod was to break or be removed, the controller will make a new one to replace it.

- ```expose rc image_name --type=LoadBalencer --name image_name-http```: rc = replicationcontroller. creates service object
- ```get services```: list service objects
- ```get rc```: list replicationcontrollers
- ```cluster-info```: display cluster and urls of kubernetes components
- ```ssh```: log into Minikube VM to explore processes running on the node

**horizontal scaling**: ```scale rc image_name --replicas=3``` define desired pod instances

### commands

- ```get nodes```: list nodes
- ```get pods [-o wide]```: list pods, ?display IP and pods node
- ```describe [node | pod] [name]```: detailed information about single or all nodes. CPU and memory data, system information, containers running on the node and more.
